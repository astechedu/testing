Features of Nginx:

Some of the crucial features of Nginx include:

    Reverse Proxy – Nginx acts as a reverse proxy, routing traffic from the internet to one or more servers running applications or services.

    Load balancing – distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers, improving the scalability and reliability of a system.

    HTTP cache – caches static content and dynamically generated content, reducing the load on the application servers and improving the performance of the system.

    SSL/TLS termination – handles SSL/TLS encryption and decryption, offloading this resource intensive process from the application servers.

    Virtual hosting – hosts multiple websites on a single server, using a technique called “virtual hosting.”

    FastCGI support – works with FastCGI servers, allowing it to serve dynamic content using scripting languages such as PHP.

    HTTP/2 support – supports the HTTP/2 protocol, which allows for faster and more efficient transfer of web content.

    Rewriting and redirection – rewrites URLs and redirects traffic, making it easy to modify the behaviour of a web server without changing the underlying application code.

    Access controls – Nginx can be configured to allow or deny access to specific resources based on the IP address, hostname, or other criteria.
