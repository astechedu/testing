Step 1: Update System and Install Required Packages

Before installing any software, you need to update and upgrade the system you are working on. To do so, run the commands:

sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get upgrade -y


Also, make sure to install (or check whether you already have) the following required packages:

sudo apt-get install curl
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https


Step 2: Install VirtualBox Hypervisor

1. To install VirtualBox on Ubuntu, run the command:

sudo apt install virtualbox virtualbox-ext-pack

2. Confirm the installation with y and hit Enter.
3. Next, the licence agreement appears on the screen. Press Tab and then Enter to continue.
4. The installer asks you to agree with the terms of the VirtualBox PUEL license by selecting Yes.
5. Wait for the installation to complete and then move on to the next step.



Step 3: Install Minikube

wget https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64

2. Copy the downloaded file and store it into the /usr/local/bin/minikube directory with:

sudo cp minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube

3. Next, give the file executive permission using the chmod command:

sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/minikube

4. Finally, verify you have successfully installed Minikube by checking the version of the software:

minikube version


Step 4: Install Kubectl

To deploy and manage clusters, you need to install kubectl, the official command line tool for Kubernetes.

1. Download kubectl with the following command:

curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/`curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt`/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl


2. Make the binary executable by typing:

chmod +x ./kubectl

3. Then, move the binary into your path with the command:

sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl

4. Verify the installation by checking the version of your kubectl instance:

kubectl version -o json

Step 5: Start Minikube

Once you have set up all the required software, you are ready to start Minikube.

Run the following command:

minikube start
