   (SELECT dept_id from emp group by dept_id HAVING COUNT(*) = 2);    //Sub Query

Example: 

   SELECT emp_name from emp where dept_id IN
   (SELECT dept_id from emp group by dept_id HAVING COUNT(*) < 5);    //Sub Query

Example: 

   SELECT emp_name from emp where dept_id IN
   (SELECT dept_id from emp group by dept_id HAVING COUNT(*) < 3);    //Sub Query

Example: 

   SELECT emp_name from emp where dept_id IN
   (SELECT dept_id from emp group by dept_id HAVING COUNT(*) = 5);    //Sub Query

What is Subquery?
Types of Subqueries
Subqueries with the SELECT Statement
Subquery with the INSERT Statement
Subqueries with the UPDATE Statement
Subqueries with the DELETE Statement


--What is Subquery--

A subquery is s select query that is enclosed inside another query 
The inner select query is usually used to determine the results of the outer select query.

.Write a SQL Query to display department with maximum salary from employees table?
. Select Dept from employees where
  salary=(select Max(salary) from employees);


Let's how this query works?

.Find the name of the employees with maximum salary int the employees table

    select Emp_name from Employees
    where salary=(select Max(salary) from employees);

Let's how this query works?
    
     First the INNER Query is executed   | select Max(salary) from employees; |

     INNER Query gives following result   Max(salary) -> 11500

     Output of inner query is substituted in outer query : Select Emp_name form employees where salary = 115000

     On execution, the outer query gives following result: Emp_name -> Joseph


Select Dept from Employees                           //Outer Query
where Salary = (Select Max(Salary) from Employees)   //Inner Query


--Types of Subqueries--

 Subqueries with the SELECT Statement
 Subqueries with the UPDATE Statement
 Subqueries with the DELETE Statement
 Subqueries with the INSERT Statement

.Subqueries with the SELECT Statement
   SQL subqueries are majorily used with SELECT statement

Syntax: 
  SELECT column_name
  From table_name WHERE
  column_name OPERATOR
  (SELECT column_name
  FROM table [WHERE])
   
.Subqueries with the SELECT Statement
  select emp_name, dept salary from employees 
  WHERE salary < (SELECT avg(salary) from employees);



--Subquery with the INSERT Statement--
      The INSERT statement uses the data returned from the subquery to insert into another table

Sntax: 

  INSERT INTO table_name
  SELECT *FROM table
  WHERE VALUE OPERATOR
  (INNER QUERY)

  INSERT INTO order SELECT product_id, p_name, sell_price FROM products
  WHERE product_id IN (SELECT product_id FROM products WHERE sell_price > 1000);


 --Subqueries with the UPDATE Statement--

    The subquery can be used in conjunction with the UPDATE statement 
    Either single of multiple columns in a table can be updated when using a 
    subquery with the UPDATE statement

   Syntax: 

   UPDATE table SET
   column_name =
   new_value WHERE
   OPERATOR
   VALUE (SELECT COLUMN_NAME FROM TABLE_NAME) WHERE)

   UPDATE EMPLOYEES 
   SET salary = salary*0.35 
   WHERE age IN (SELECT age FROM employees_B WHERE age >=27);


 --Subqueries with the DELETE Statement--

   The subquery can be used in conjunction with the DELETE statement
  
   Syntax:

     DELETE FROM
     TABLE_NAME VALUE 
     (INNER QUERY)




 --Subqueries with the INSERT Statement--

  DELETE FROM employees 
  WHERE age IN 
  (SELECT age FROM employees WHERE age >=27)

    Subquery basics
    Using subqueries to aggregate in multiple stages
    Subqueries in conditional logic

Subquery basics:

//Using subqueries to aggregate in multiple stages:
